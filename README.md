Recreate minesweeper Game

What is MineSweeper?
Minesweeper game features a grid of clickable squares, with hidden "mines" scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

Why MineSweeper?
Didn't know how to

Key Learnings
-Practising and applying what I have learnt(dom, higher order functions etc)
-Learning to source for answer and integrating it to your code
-console.log when you are stuck to find out what is wrong

1. Approach and process
   Something I would have done differently would be cater more time to the planning the whole game. User story was not well thought out hence when more component was added, codes that interacted with that portion had to be amended. Committing my work when part of code completed saved me a lot of time as it was I was able to track what changed.

2. Code and code design
   //Bad
   Halfway through I realize I was hard coding most of the component which make manipulating components difficult when I had to add/remove components. Another bad code design was DRY coding...it was very hard for me to remember what I've changed. Lastly, code in a way so that your code can be reused.

   //Did well
   Practices in class helped me to craft out the logic

3. Future improvements

- Refactor the code so that expert difficulty can be built
- A timer and scoreboard

Summary
It was a good learning experience for me as I manage understand new concepts along the way. Having a positive mindset and not giving up goes a long way.
